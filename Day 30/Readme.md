# Deploying an E-Commerce three tier application on AWS EKS

- We will use a demo e-commerce project that sells Robots and AI products. This demo project is created using 12 components that includes 8 micro services, 2 Databases, 1 messaging queue and 1 In memory data store.

Note: All microservices should be in single programming language or multiple programming languages

|Monolithic Architecture|Microservices Architecture|
|---|---|
|A monolithic architecture is a singular, large computing network with one code base that couples all of the business concerns together.|A microservices architecture, also simply known as microservices, is an architectural method that relies on a series of independently deployable services. These services have their own business logic and database with a specific goal. Updating, testing, deployment, and scaling occur within each service|
|To make a change to this sort of application requires updating the entire stack by accessing the code base and building and deploying an updated version of the service-side interface.|Microservices decouple major business, domain-specific concerns into separate, independent code bases|
|This makes updates restrictive and time-consuming.|Microservices donâ€™t reduce complexity, but they make any complexity visible and more manageable by separating tasks into smaller processes that function independently of each other and contribute to the overall whole|
|Monoliths can be convenient early on in a project's life for ease of code management, cognitive overhead, and deployment. This allows everything in the monolith to be released at once.|Adopting microservices often goes hand in hand with DevOps, since they are the basis for continuous delivery practices that allow teams to adapt quickly to user requirements|
|Advantages: <br>- Easy deployment <br>- easy Development <br>-performance <br>- simplified testing <br>- easy debugging |Advantages: <br>- Agility <br> - flexible scaling <br>- continuous deployment <br>- highly maintainable and testable <br>- Independently deployable <br>-Technology flexiblity <br>- High reliability <br>- Happier teams|
|Disadvantages: <br>- slower development speed <br>- scalability <br>- reliability <br>- Barrier to technology adoption <br>- lack of flexibility <br>- deployment|Disadvantages: <br>- Development sprawl <br>- Exponential infrastructure costs <br>- added organization overhead <br>- debugging challenge <br>- lack of standardization <br>- lack of clear ownership |
