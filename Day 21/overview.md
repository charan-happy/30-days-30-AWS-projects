Problem :

Sometimes, developers create EC2 instances with volumes attached to them by default. For backup purposes, these developers also create snapshots. However, when they no longer need the EC2 instance and decide to terminate it, they sometimes forget to delete the snapshots created for backup. As a result, they continue to incur costs for these unused snapshots, even though they are not actively using them.

Solution :

We’re using AWS to save money on storage costs. We made a Smart Lambda function that looks at our snapshots and our EC2 instances. If Lambda finds a snapshot that isn’t connected to any active EC2 instances, it deletes it to save us money. This helps us keep our AWS costs down.

Note :

There are many similar problems like this. For instance, we might attach an Elastic IP to our EC2 instance but forget to delete the Elastic IP after terminating the EC2 instance. In such a case, the Elastic IP continues to incur costs for us. This Project is One of the use case. You can Easily Develop this Project by Forking the Below Repo.
